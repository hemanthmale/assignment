FinEdge - Transforming Cross-Border Payments

This is a landing page for FinEdge, a fintech startup dedicated to revolutionizing cross-border payments. The landing page showcases the services offered by FinEdge and provides information about the company's mission and vision.

Design and Development Process
The design and development process for the FinEdge landing page involved the following steps:

HTML Structure: The landing page was built using HTML, which provides the foundation and structure for the content. The HTML elements were carefully organized to create a logical and semantic structure, ensuring accessibility and ease of maintenance.

CSS Styling: CSS was used to style the HTML elements and bring the design to life. The team defined styles for headers, paragraphs, images, navigation, sections, and other elements to achieve a consistent and visually appealing presentation. Responsive design techniques were implemented to ensure optimal viewing on different devices.

JavaScript Interactivity: JavaScript was incorporated to add interactivity and functionality to the landing page. A JavaScript event listener was added to handle the form submission in the contact section. It validates the input fields and provides a success message upon successful submission.
